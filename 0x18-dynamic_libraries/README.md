Shared libraries (also called dynamic libraries) are linked into the program in two stages. First, during compile time, the linker verifies that all the symbols (again, functions, variables and the like) required by the program, are either linked into the program, or in one of its shared libraries.
Dynamic libraries are loaded at runtime and are not included in the executable. This reduces the size of executable files. Dynamic libraries use relocatable code format. This code is turned into absolute code by the runtime linker.
