Doubly linked list is  a list that consists of a bunch of nodes and each node has the ability to hold some data, and whereby each node gas the ability to link to the next or previous node.
Here a node comprises of three partitions if I may call them that:
	  i)first partition holds the node's data
	 ii)second part holds a pointer to the next node or null if it's the last node.
	iii)finally one holds the pointer to the previous node or null if it's the first node.
In this project we used this knowledge to accomplish various tasks.
